The application was created as part of programming practice. It consists of a showcase website written in HTML, a frontend written in React available after logging in, and a backend written in Express. In this web application, I used various libraries. For the frontend, these included Bootstrap, Axios, Day.js, Howler, Redux, and React Router. For the backend, I used Nodemon, MySQL, MongoDB, JWT.io, bcrypt, html-pdf-node, and Handlebars.
